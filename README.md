Who knows! Time to brainstorm.

GPS & microcontroller to generate coordinates!
This is pretty mindblowing that we could do this. It spells it all out, but i bet it would be a challenge nonetheless. If we finish and want to expand on it, we could tackle to power side and use a battery instead of the cable. We could get really into electronics and design a circuit and make a integrated version... and/or figure out another module to link up to cellular connection... at this point we'd have a realtime gps tracker. as far as microcontrollers i like the AVR ones. i have a couple we could use. cheap and the same instruction set as arduino bc thats AVR too.

Anything with cellular connection.. the more i read the more of a pain seems to be. i can't figure out a good route to go. the 2g (edge) boards are nice and simple and cheap but carriers have all but discontinued service for that frequency... basically the same thing is happening for 3g. and then LTE boards are really expensive and overkill. theres some iot frequencies but they are still young: nb-iot and lora... not enough adoption but in a couple years that could be cool idk. this is what niru does for research i think? so maybe we should ask her. but ANYWAY, a backup solution would be to have a proj with a bluetooth module and then write the code (somehow) to link it up to a.. linux phone!? so theres mobility without the lte module as part of the project.
