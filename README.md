Who knows! Time to brainstorm.

GPS & microcontroller to generate coordinates!
This is pretty mindblowing that we could do this. It spells it all out, but i bet it would be a challenge nonetheless. If we finish and want to expand on it, we could tackle to power side and use a battery instead of the cable. We could get really into electronics and design a circuit and make a integrated version... and/or figure out another module to link up to cellular connection... at this point we'd have a realtime gps tracker. as far as microcontrollers i like the AVR ones. i have a couple we could use. cheap and the same instruction set as arduino bc thats AVR too.
